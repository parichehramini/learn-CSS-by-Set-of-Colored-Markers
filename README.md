# 🎨 CSS Color Markers

A mini project built as part of freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certification.  
This challenge was about learning different CSS color formats by building colored markers.

## 📘 What I Learned

- CSS color types: `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`
- Using `linear-gradient()` to blend multiple colors
- Styling with `box-shadow` and `border-left`
- Organizing HTML structure with `div` and `class`

## 💡 Features

- Three beautiful markers: Red, Green, Blue 🖍️
- Caps with solid colors and sleeves with transparency
- Clean design with subtle shadows and gradients

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – HTML structure
- `styles.css` – All the marker styles

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo
