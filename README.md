# CSS Color Markers Project

This is a small but colorful project built as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.  
The goal of this challenge is to learn and practice how CSS colors work by building a set of colored markers using basic HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned

- How to apply different CSS color formats (named colors, hex, rgba)
- How to use `background-color` and `border` properties
- How to use the `border-left` shorthand to simplify code
- How to create simple layouts with visual styling

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Project Features

- Three markers: red, green, and blue
- Each marker includes a cap and a sleeve
- Use of `rgba()` to create transparency
- Clean styling using `border-left` shorthand

## Preview

You can view a screenshot of the result below:

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure
- `styles.css` – Contains the CSS styling

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. Observe the styled markers.

## Notes

This was completed in Step 82 of freeCodeCamp's "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers" project.  
It demonstrates how to use the `border-left` shorthand property effectively to simplify CSS.
