# 🎨 CSS Color Markers Project

This is a small but colorful project built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).  
The goal of this challenge is to learn and practice how CSS colors work by building a set of colored markers using basic HTML and CSS.

## 📚 What I Learned

- 🎨 How to apply different CSS color formats (`named colors`, `hex`, `rgba`)
- 💡 How to use `background-color` and `border` properties
- ✂️ How to simplify code using the `border-left` shorthand
- 🧱 How layout and styling work together for clean UI design

## 💻 Tech Used

- ⚙️ HTML5  
- 🎨 CSS3

## 🖌️ Project Features

- 🖍️ Three colored markers: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**
- 🧢 Each marker includes a **cap** and a **sleeve**
- 🌫️ Semi-transparent sleeve using `rgba()`
- 📏 Clean border styling with `border-left`

## 🔍 Preview

Here's a quick look at the final result:



## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` → Markup for the markers  
- `styles.css` → Styling for the cap and sleeve

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Enjoy the colorful marker layout and explore the CSS in action!

## 🧠 Notes

This project was built in **Step 82** of the _"Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers"_ lesson on freeCodeCamp.  
It focuses on using the `border-left` shorthand property to clean up repetitive code.
